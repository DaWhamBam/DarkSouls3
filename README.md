## Hero RPG Fight 1.0
Hallo,  
   
**Short description of the project**  
the whole project is my first ever. As part of my training as an
App developer all students are assigned a project for the module completion.
My result of the 9 days project time can be found here.

Since I am a complete newbie in programming I lack the knowledge and experience to implement everything I have planned in advance.
  
**Description**  
My idea was to create a textadventure in the style of ZORK, Colossal Adventure and the like. The whole thing was before my time but gaming is a part of my life and that helped me a lot to realize this first big project.

The project was scaled down a lot to achieve a usable experience in the given time. Thought were still character values, immunities, random battles, an explorable world and much more. Eventually I will expand the whole thing little by little... But time is scarce at the moment.
  
**Content of the project**   
One (1) complete battle against one opponent (Dragon)!!!
The fight always starts with 3 heroes (warrior, mage, healer) and a dragon as boss. The dragon still has the possibility to get helpers by a call for help to his side. But you can only fight a maximum of 2 enemies at the same time. Each character can decide at the beginning if he wants to attack directly or if he wants to open the inventory. The inventory has 3 possibilities to influence the fight. Healing potion, protection stone and throwing knife. The actual fight consists of several attacks that each character can use.
Each character can attack or block. Additionally the healer has the possibility to heal himself or allies. The boss (dragon) and all other assistants make their attacks randomly and are diced in the background. The opponents also have the option to attack or block.
A battle continues until either all heroes have been defeated (Lost) or all opponents are defeated (Won).
